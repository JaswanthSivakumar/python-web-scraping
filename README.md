# Web Scraping for Data Analysis Using Python

This project is a Python-based tool for web scraping and data analysis that gathers population data from a public website, processes it, and visualizes the information using Plotly. The tool automates data scraping, cleaning, and storage, making it easy to analyze population trends over time.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Extracts population data from a specified website.
- **Data Cleaning**: Formats and processes the raw data for accuracy and consistency.
- **Database Storage**: Saves cleaned data to an SQLite database.
- **Data Export**: Exports data to a CSV file.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes population and growth trends using interactive charts.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup4`
- `pandas`
- `plotly`
- `schedule`
- `sqlite3` (built-in)
- `logging` (built-in)


# Project Structure

- `WebScraper` **class**: Handles data extraction, cleaning, and saving to SQLite.
- `Dashboard` **class**: Generates an interactive dashboard for data visualization.
- **Main Script**(`job` function): Coordinates the scraping, processing, and visualization tasks.

  ## Usage

  1. Run the Script Once: The script scrapes data, processes it, saves it in a database, exports it as a CSV, and displays a dashboard.
     `python your_script.py`.
  2. Automate with Scheduling: By default, the script is set to run immediately. For scheduled scraping, use libraries like `schedule` or a task scheduler (e.g., cron).

  ## Code Overview

  ### WebScraper Class
- `crape_webpage()`: Scrapes population data from the specified URL.
- `clean_data()`: Cleans and formats data columns for accurate analysis.
- `save_to_database()`: Stores data in an SQLite database.
- `export_data()`: Exports the scraped data to `population_data.csv`.
### Dashboard Class
- `create_dashboard()`: Visualizes the population and yearly change using Plotly charts.
### Example USAGE
 This project uses population data from `'https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/'`
 
## Logging
 Logs are created for each major step (scraping, cleaning, saving, exporting, and visualizing), aiding in debugging and progress monitoring.

 ## Future Enhancements
- Add additional visualizations (e.g., top 10 populous countries).
- Implement email notifications for data updates.
- Schedule the scraping and analysis to run daily.
