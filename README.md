# Web Scraping for Data Analysis Using Python

This project is a Python-based tool for web scraping and data analysis that gathers population data from a public website, processes it, and visualizes the information using Plotly. The tool automates data scraping, cleaning, and storage, making it easy to analyze population trends over time.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Extracts population data from a specified website.
- **Data Cleaning**: Formats and processes the raw data for accuracy and consistency.
- **Database Storage**: Saves cleaned data to an SQLite database.
- **Data Export**: Exports data to a CSV file.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes population and growth trends using interactive charts.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup4`
- `pandas`
- `plotly`
- `schedule`
- `sqlite3` (built-in)
- `logging` (built-in)


# Project Structure

### Explanation

- **data/**: Stores exported CSV data files.
- **db/**: Contains the SQLite database (`population_data.db`) where cleaned data is stored.
- **logs/**: Contains log files (like `scraping.log`) for tracking scraping and data processing activities.
- **scripts/**: Stores modular scripts:
  - `web_scraper.py`: Contains the `WebScraper` class for scraping and cleaning data.
  - `database_manager.py`: Manages database creation and data insertion.
  - `dashboard.py`: Contains the `Dashboard` class for generating data visualizations.
- **main.py**: Main script to execute the entire data scraping, processing, and visualization pipeline.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists required libraries; useful for setting up dependencies quickly.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

### Note

This structure can be modified based on your needs, especially if you want to keep everything in a single script. This modular approach is helpful for larger projects and easier maintenance.
